DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE MODEL TO IDENTIFY EARLY SIGNS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN ADOLESCENTS USING SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY, SCHOOL PERFORMANCE DATA, AND ANONYMOUS HEALTH RECORDS

# Step 1: Social Media Activity:
Users can link their social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Whatsapp) or upload data such as posts, comments, or activity logs.
For demo purpose we are extracting user's REDDIT and WHATSAPP data.

The app would analyze the emotional tone of their posts (Mentally Normal or Not Normal) by naive bayes,DENSE and LSTM ensemble modelling.

# Step 2: School Performance Data:
Users can upload academic reports or provide access to school performance data (e.g., grades, attendance records, remarks).

The app will extract data from uploaded images into dataframes through tessaract OCR
and then detect changes in performance that may correlate with mental health issues, such as SUDDEN DROPS IN GRADES, INCREASED ABSENTEEISM and sentiment in TEACHER REMARKS by Data Analaysis

# Step 3: Anonymous Health Records:
Users can upload anonymized health records, including any previous psychological evaluations, physical health data, or history of mental health consultations.
The app would analyze these records for any red flags related to mental well-being (e.g., patterns of anxiety, stress, or depression).

# Step 4: AI Chatbot
Description: The user interacts with an AI-powered chatbot that asks questions related to their daily life and mental state. Implementation:
Conversational Analysis: The chatbot evaluates the userâ€™s responses for sentiment and tone, detecting signs of potential mental health issues.
Voice Assistance: Integration of voice recognition to assess the tone and emotion in spoken responses.
Multilingual Support: The chatbot can communicate in multiple languages to make the service more accessible.
Goal: Provide real-time analysis of the user's mental state based on their responses and identify potential mental health issues.

# Step 5: Personalized Recommendations and Resources
Description: Based on collected data and analysis, provide users with personalized mental wellness tips, recommended readings, or mental health resources.
Implementation:
Recommendation System: Generate personalized tips, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness practices, or local mental health resources.
Integration with Mental Health Resources: Offer links to therapists, support groups, or crisis helplines.
Goal: Empower users to take proactive steps in mental health management with customized support.

# Recommendations:
If a user shows signs of mental health issues, the application could recommend further evaluation or resources, such as speaking to a counselor, accessing mental health support services, or using self-help techniques.
